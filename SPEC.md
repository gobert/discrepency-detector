# Discrepency Detector

## Background
Imagine there is an app that allows employees from an HR department to advertise jobs. For this purpose an employee creates an advertising campaign (described below) for each job in the database. Periodically some services in the app interact with a 3rd party AdService through REST API. The result of this interaction is creation or update of an Ad on the AdService side. Ad properties (described below) correspond to some of the campaign properties. Due to various types of failures (AdService inavailability, errors in campaign details etc.) the latest state of a campaign on the app side may not be always propagated to the AdService.

## Task
The goal of the task is to implement a service which is capable of detecting discrepancies between the state of the campaigns on the app side and ads on the AdService side.
Tech Details campaign properties
- id
- job_id
- status: one of [active, paused, deleted]
- external_reference: corresponds to Ad’s ‘reference’
- ad_description: text description of an Ad

### AdService REST API

Request
GET http://mockbin.org/bin/fcb30500-7b98-476f-810d-463a0b8fc3df

Response(JSON)
Returns a JSON object with ‘ads’ property which holds list of Ad objects.
ad properties
- reference: id generated by AdService
- status: one of ['enabled', 'disabled' ].
- description: ad description

Example:
```json
{  
   "ads":[  
      {  
         "reference":"1",
         "status":"enabled",
         "description":"Description for campaign 11"
      },
      {  
         "reference":"2",
         "status":"disabled",
         "description":"Description for campaign 12"
      },
      {  
         "reference":"3",
         "status":"enabled",
         "description":"Description for campaign 13"
      }
   ]
}
```
Imagine that the output will be used by ‘admins’ in order to analyse the state of campaigns and ads. The structure of the output is for you to design. It should not be necessarily saved to a DB but should be ready to be used in an admin panel or other UI. Nevertheless UI is not part of this test task.

Taking into account that campaign’s ‘active’ status corresponds to ad’s ‘enabled’ status and ‘paused’ to ‘disabled’. You should think of other status combinations that can lead to discrepancies.
Please keep in mind that the service should be ready for extension through various other use cases.
